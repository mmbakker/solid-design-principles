# Dependency injection

In short:

> In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends
> on, called dependencies. Typically, the receiving object is called a client and the passed-in ('injected') object is
> called a service. The code that passes the service to the client is called the injector. Instead of the client
> specifying which service it will use, the injector tells the client what service to use. The 'injection' refers to the
> passing of a dependency (a service) into the client that uses it.
